Running PCA for ligand1...
PCA1 explains: 91.1% of the points' variance...
Consider this is a measure on how linear the input ligand is. The lower this value, the more likely it will be to get clashes in the final structure.
Running PCA for ligand2...
PCA1 explains: 92.8% of the points' variance...
Consider this is a measure on how linear the input ligand is. The lower this value, the more likely it will be to get clashes in the final structure.
