Checking ligand1 mol2 file...
14 atoms were found in the mol2 file...
Checking if columns 3, 4, and 5 correspond to floating numbers...
The name found for the connecting atom in the mol2 file is 'C1'...
The connecting atom was identified to be atom 1...
Initializing ligand1...
There are no capping atoms in the structure...
Initializing core...
Running PCA for ligand1...
PCA1 explains: 60.9% of the points' variance...
Consider this is a measure on how linear the input ligand is. The lower this value, the more likely it will be to get clashes in the final structure.
Assigning a random distribution of the ligands...
Coating nanoparticle...
Clashes were found while placing residue 234...
Trying to solve the clashes...
Clashes were found while placing residue 253...
