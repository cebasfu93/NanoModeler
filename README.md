NanoModeler v0.1

Known bugs:
-None. NanoModeler is perfect.
-But ligands must consist of only one residue due to the saveoff .lib in tleap.
-When the mol2 is rewriten, the third term in the SUBSTRUCTURE section (the root atom) is always set to 1. It doesn't seem to bring any problem so far.

Perspectives:
-Make a broader check of possible errors.
